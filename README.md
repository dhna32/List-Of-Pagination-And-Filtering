# List-Of-Pagination-And-Filtering
This repo contains the Unit 2 project from Full-Stack Javascript.TeamTreehouse

In this project we're working with basic DOM Manipulation. Surely it was difficult
but I can tell that I've already have dominated the basics of this topic. 

Things I learned:

- Create, append and modify DOM Elements
- Strengthen my loops and arrays knowledge
- How to interact with my classmates
- Scope and the current context of execution in each variable
- Strengthen my skills in DevTools.



BASIC DOM TREE generated in the script

DIV.PAGINATION
            ---- UL
                ----- LI
                      ----- A

Great project :)
